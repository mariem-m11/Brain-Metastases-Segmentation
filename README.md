# Overview:
This repository explores the application of advanced deep learning models for the segmentation of brain metastases, focusing on the implementation of nnUNet and 3D TransUNet architectures using the BraTS METS 2023 dataset. It also delves into customizing the loss functions to incorporate the Hausdorff distance, a metric that significantly enhances the precision of boundary delineation in medical images.
